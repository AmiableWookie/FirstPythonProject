Description: Working with the Git Bash terminal, GitHub, and Python to build two scripts for campaign and election data. The task is to read .csv files and use the scripts to parse the data with 'For loops' and 'With' statements, as well as write-to .txt file functionality.

Disclaimer for source materials: Code for this script was taught through edX Boot Camps LLC and its staff. Inspiration and reference for use of 'With' statement in line 83 is from a StackOverflow thread at URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47513050/how-do-i-write-to-txt-file-in-for-loop-python.
